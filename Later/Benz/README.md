# Benz

Benz is a super tiny scheme interpreter intended to be embedded in other applications such as game engine and network server. It provides a subset language of R7RS with several useful extensions. By default, Benz just contains some C files and headers and this README file. In embedding, you only need to copy the files into the project and add `include` dir to the include path.

Originally, Benz used to be the core component of [Picrin Scheme](https://github.com/picrin-scheme/picrin). They are currently maintained at separate repositories.

## Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#include "picrin.h"
#include "picrin/extra.h"

/* Simple REPL program */

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  pic_state *pic;
  pic_value expr;

  pic = pic_open(pic_default_allocf, NULL);

  while (1) {
    printf("> ");

    expr = pic_read(pic, pic_stdin(pic));

    if (pic_eof_p(pic, expr)) {
      break;
    }

    pic_printf(pic, "~s\n", pic_eval(pic, expr, "picrin.user"));
  }

  pic_close(pic);

  return 0;
}
```

## More Example

Function binding is also easy. `pic_defun` defines a scheme procedure converting from a C function. In the native function, callee arguments can be taken with `pic_get_args`. `pic_get_args` gets arguments according to the format string. If actual arguments does not match a number or incompatible types, it will raise an exception.

```c
#include "picrin.h"
#include "picrin/extra.h"

int fact(int i) {
  return i == 1 ? 1 : i * fact(i - 1);
}

pic_value factorial(pic_state *pic) {
  int i;

  pic_get_args(pic, "i", &i);

  return pic_int_value(pic, fact(i));
}

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  pic_state *pic = pic_open(pic_default_allocf, NULL);

  pic_defun(pic, "fact", factorial); /* define fact procedure */

  pic_load_cstr(pic, "(display (fact 10))");

  pic_close(pic);

  return 0;
}
```

## Language

All procedures and syntaces are exported from a single library named `(picrin base)`. The complete list is found at https://gist.github.com/wasabiz/344d802a2340d1f734b7 .

### call/cc

Full continuation has many problems in embbeding into applications. By default, Benz's call/cc operator does not support continuation that can handle re-entering (it only supports escape continuations). To remove this restriction, please use an add-on provided from [Picrin Scheme's repository](https://github.com/picrin-scheme/picrin/tree/master/contrib/03.callcc).

### Strings

Benz utilize rope data structure to implement string type. Thanks to the implementation, string-append is guaranteed to be done in a constant time (so do string-copy, when ascii-only mode is enabled). In return for that, strings in benz are immutable by default. It does not provide mutation API (string-set!, string-copy! and string-fill! in R7RS). This restriction can be also removed with an add-on in [Picrin Scheme's repository](https://github.com/picrin-scheme/picrin/tree/master/contrib/03.mutable-string).

### Dictionaries

Dictionary is a hash table object. Its equivalence is tested with equal? procedure.

### Attribute

Benz has an facility to get or set metadata to any heap object.
